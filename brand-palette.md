# Brand Palette Reference

| Token | Hex | Suggested Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brand.navy` | `#0C1E36` | Primary background, headers, body text on light surfaces |
| `brand.teal` | `#1BB3A4` | Accent color for buttons, highlights, call-to-action text |
| `brand.gray` | `#5B6168` | Secondary typography, dividers, muted UI elements |
| `brand.sky` | `#2E9BE8` | Supporting accent for data viz, hover states, subtle gradients |

**Typography & Wordmark**
- Wordmark uses `brand.navy` for “Aero Crew” and `brand.teal` for “Data”.
- Recommended font pairing: Inter (semibold for headings, regular for body), with system sans fallbacks.

**Supporting Guidance**
- Maintain high contrast: when using `brand.navy` as background, pair with white (`#FFFFFF`) or light slate (`#F8FAFC`).
- For PDFs or print, reserve `brand.sky` for highlights and data points; avoid overusing to keep `brand.teal` as the primary accent.
- Shadows and subtle borders can lean on semi-transparent versions of `brand.navy` (e.g., `rgba(12, 30, 54, 0.15)`).
