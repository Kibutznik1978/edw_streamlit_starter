# Session 25 - Pay Period Distribution Breakdown

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Focus:** Add separate pay period distribution tables and charts for both app and PDF reports
**Branch:** `refractor`

---

## Overview

This session added comprehensive pay period breakdown functionality to the Bid Line Analyzer, allowing users to see distributions for each individual pay period (PP1, PP2) in addition to the overall combined distributions.

### Goals Achieved

âœ… Added pay period breakdown section to app Visuals tab
âœ… Added pay period breakdown pages to PDF reports
âœ… Smart detection of single vs. multiple pay periods
âœ… All 4 metrics (CT, BT, DO, DD) shown for each period
âœ… Consistent reserve line filtering across all charts
âœ… All syntax validation passing

---

## User Request

User wanted to see distribution tables and charts separated by pay period, in addition to the overall distributions:
> "Lets to the distribution tables seperate pay period tables. So in addition to the overall distributions show each pay period distribution. If there are two pay periods. Remember its possible to have a single pay period bid period."

---

## Changes Made

### 1. App Visuals Tab (`ui_modules/bid_line_analyzer_page.py`)

**File:** `ui_modules/bid_line_analyzer_page.py`
**Lines Modified:** 429-683 (~250 lines added)

**Added:**
- **Smart pay period detection** at the start of `_render_visuals_tab()`:
  ```python
  has_multiple_periods = False
  pay_periods_df = None
  if diagnostics and diagnostics.pay_periods is not None:
      pay_periods_df = diagnostics.pay_periods
      filtered_pay_periods = pay_periods_df[pay_periods_df["Line"].isin(filtered_df["Line"])]
      unique_periods = filtered_pay_periods["Period"].unique()
      has_multiple_periods = len(unique_periods) > 1
  ```

- **"Overall Distributions" section header** (lines 463-466):
  - Added section header to clarify these are combined distributions
  - Shows caption "Combined data across all pay periods" when multiple periods exist

- **"Pay Period Breakdown" section** (lines 590-683):
  - Only appears when `has_multiple_periods = True`
  - Iterates through each pay period (PP1, PP2, etc.)
  - For each period, creates separate distributions for all 4 metrics:
    - Credit Time (CT) - 5-hour buckets, interactive Plotly charts
    - Block Time (BT) - 5-hour buckets, interactive Plotly charts
    - Days Off (DO) - whole numbers, Streamlit bar charts
    - Duty Days (DD) - whole numbers, Streamlit bar charts
  - Each metric shows both count and percentage charts side-by-side
  - Proper reserve line filtering applied (consistent with overall)
  - Dividers between pay periods for visual separation

**UI Structure:**

### 2. PDF Generation (`pdf_generation/bid_line_pdf.py`)

**File:** `pdf_generation/bid_line_pdf.py`
**Lines Modified:** 560-870 (~310 lines added)

**Added:**
- **Duty Days (DD) overall distribution** (lines 560-624):
  - Was missing from the PDF report before!
  - Now shows DD distribution table and charts on Page 3
  - Uses pay_periods data for accurate counts (not averaged)
  - Includes note about data source

- **Pay Period Breakdown section** (lines 626-870):
  - Only appears when `len(unique_periods) > 1`
  - Adds dedicated pages for pay period breakdown
  - For each period, generates:
    - All 4 distribution tables (CT, BT, DO, DD)
    - Count and percentage charts for each metric (side-by-side)
    - Proper page breaks and formatting
  - Structure:
    ```python
    story.append(PageBreak())  # New page for breakdown
    story.append(Paragraph("Pay Period Breakdown", heading2_style))

    for period in unique_periods:
        story.append(Paragraph(f"Pay Period {int(period)}", heading2_style))

        # CT Distribution
        [table + charts]

        # BT Distribution
        [table + charts]

        # DO Distribution
        [table + charts]

        # DD Distribution
        [table + charts]

        # Divider between periods
        story.append(hr)

    story.append(PageBreak())  # Before buy-up analysis
    ```

**PDF Structure Now:**
- **Page 1:** KPIs, Summary stats, Pay period comparison
- **Page 2:** Overall CT and BT distributions
- **Page 3:** Overall DO and DD distributions
- **Pages 4+:** Pay period breakdown (PP1, PP2) - **only if multiple periods**
- **Last Page:** Buy-up analysis

## Technical Details

### Reserve Line Filtering

**Consistent logic across all distributions (app and PDF):**

```python
# Regular reserve lines (exclude from CT, DO, DD)
regular_reserve_mask = (reserve_df['IsReserve'] == True) & (reserve_df['IsHotStandby'] == False)
reserve_line_numbers = set(reserve_df[regular_reserve_mask]['Line'].tolist())

# HSBY lines (exclude only from BT)
hsby_mask = reserve_df['IsHotStandby'] == True
hsby_line_numbers = set(reserve_df[hsby_mask]['Line'].tolist())

# Filter datasets
df_non_reserve = df[~df['Line'].isin(reserve_line_numbers)]  # For CT, DO, DD
df_for_bt = df[~df['Line'].isin(all_exclude_for_bt)]  # For BT (excludes reserve + HSBY)
```

### Pay Period Data Usage

**All distributions now use `pay_periods` DataFrame:**
- DO/DD: Already using pay periods (fixed in Session 24)
- CT/BT: Overall uses averaged data, per-period uses actual period data
- Each pay period shows actual values for that specific period
- No averaging or aggregation in pay period breakdown

### Smart Behavior

**Single Pay Period:**
- Shows only "Overall Distributions" section
- No breakdown section appears
- Clean, simple interface

**Multiple Pay Periods:**
- Shows "Overall Distributions" with caption
- Shows "Pay Period Breakdown" section below
- Each period gets its own set of charts
- Clear visual separation with headers and dividers

## Testing & Validation

### Syntax Validation
```bash
$ python -m py_compile app.py ui_modules/bid_line_analyzer_page.py pdf_generation/bid_line_pdf.py
âœ“ All syntax checks passed
```

### Import Validation
```bash
$ python -c "import app; print('App import successful')"
App import successful
âœ“ All imports successful
```

### Code Metrics

**Files Modified:**
- `ui_modules/bid_line_analyzer_page.py` (+~250 lines)
- `pdf_generation/bid_line_pdf.py` (+~310 lines)

**Total Added:** ~560 lines of new functionality

**Breaking Changes:** None - backward compatible with single pay period PDFs

---

## User Impact

**Before Session 25:**
- Only overall distributions visible
- DO/DD showed combined pay period data
- No way to see per-period differences
- Limited analysis capabilities for split lines

**After Session 25:**
- Overall + per-period distributions
- Clear breakdown for PP1, PP2, etc.
- Easy comparison between periods
- Complete transparency into data

---

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Side-by-Side Period Comparison:**
   - Show PP1 and PP2 charts next to each other
   - Highlight differences between periods
   - Delta calculations (PP2 - PP1)

2. **Collapsible Sections:**
   - Allow users to expand/collapse pay period breakdowns
   - Reduce scrolling for users who only want overall view
   - Session state to remember user preferences

3. **Period Filtering:**
   - Allow users to select which periods to include in overall
   - Useful for analyzing specific timeframes
   - Could support partial month analysis

4. **Statistical Comparison:**
   - T-tests or other statistical tests between periods
   - Identify significant differences
   - Confidence intervals
