## Session 8 Accomplishments (October 19, 2025)

### Major Bug Fixes

#### 28. **Fix Phantom Duty Days Bug (BID2601)** ✅
- **Problem:** Average legs per duty day showing 0.88 instead of ~1.77
- **Root Cause:** Fallback duty day detection triggering on time line immediately after "Briefing"
  - Pattern matched: `(23)07:40` (time) → `1h00` (duration) → `Duty` (label)
  - Created phantom "Day 2" while saving empty "Day 1" with 0 legs, 0 duration, 0 block
- **Impact Before Fix:**
  - 50% of duty days had 0 legs ❌
  - Average: 0.88 legs per duty day ❌
  - Total duty days: 2,254 (should be 1,127) ❌
- **Solution:** Changed fallback condition from `and not in_duty` to checking if "Briefing" appeared in last 2 lines
  ```python
  recent_briefing = any(
      i - offset >= 0 and re.search(r'\bBriefing\b', lines[i - offset], re.IGNORECASE)
      for offset in range(1, 3)
  )
  if not recent_briefing:
      # Allow fallback to trigger
  ```
- **Impact After Fix:**
  - 0% of duty days have 0 legs ✅
  - Average: 1.77 legs per duty day ✅
  - Total duty days: 1,127 (correct) ✅
- **Files:** `edw_reporter.py:150-165, 231-246, 396-416`
- **Commit:** `dea34d6`

#### 29. **Fix MD-11 Multi-Day Trip Collapsing (BID2501)** ✅
- **Problem:** Trip 337 showing 1 duty day with 6 legs instead of 4 duty days
- **Root Cause:** Previous phantom duty day fix (`and not current_duty_day`) blocked fallback from detecting duty days 2, 3, 4
  - After creating first duty day, `current_duty_day` was never None again
  - Fallback couldn't trigger for subsequent duty days in MD-11 format
- **Solution:** Same fix as #28 - check for recent "Briefing" instead of duty day state
- **Impact:**
  - Before: Trip 337 = 1 duty day with 6 legs ❌
  - After: Trip 337 = 4 duty days with proper leg distribution ✅
- **Files:** Same as #28
- **Commit:** `fec864f`

#### 30. **Fix Missing Duty/Block Times for MD-11 Duty Days** ✅
- **Problem:** Days 2, 3, 4 of multi-day trips showing 0.0h duration and 0.0h block time
- **Root Cause:** Duty/block extraction only triggered at "Debriefing" or "Duty Time:" markers
  - These markers don't appear between duty days in MD-11 format
  - When next duty day started, previous duty day was appended WITHOUT extracting times first
- **MD-11 Structure:**
  ```
  (20)01:05      ← Fallback detects Day 2 start
  1h00
  Duty
  11h00          ← Duty time (not extracted!)
  ...flights...
  Block
  5h37           ← Block time (not extracted!)
  Rest
  ...
  (18)02:00      ← Fallback detects Day 3 start → Day 2 appended with 0.0h
  ```
- **Solution:** Extract duty/block times in two places:
  1. **When starting new duty day** - Before appending previous duty day (lines 250-269)
  2. **For last duty day** - At end of trip (lines 352-371)
  ```python
  if current_duty_day:
      # Extract duty/block times before appending (for MD-11 format)
      if briefing_line_idx is not None and current_duty_day['duration_hours'] == 0.0:
          for j in range(briefing_line_idx, i):
              # Search for "Duty" and "Block" labels with times on next line
  ```
- **Impact:**
  - Before: Days 2-4 showed 0.0h duration and 0.0h block ❌
  - After: All duty days show correct times ✅
- **Testing:** Trip 337 now shows:
  - Day 1: 1 leg, 2.45h duty, 1.2h block ✅
  - Day 2: 2 legs, 11.0h duty, 5.63h block ✅
  - Day 3: 2 legs, 8.9h duty, 4.72h block ✅
  - Day 4: 1 leg, 2.52h duty, 1.27h block ✅
- **Files:** `edw_reporter.py:248-275, 350-377`
- **Commit:** `fec864f`

### UI Enhancements

#### 31. **Duty Day Statistics Display** ✅
- **What:** Added new statistics section showing average legs, duty length, and block time per duty day
- **Metrics Shown:**
  - Avg Legs/Duty Day (All, EDW, Non-EDW)
  - Avg Duty Day Length (All, EDW, Non-EDW)
  - Avg Block Time (All, EDW, Non-EDW)
- **Features:**
  - Metric filter radio buttons (All Metrics, Avg Legs, Avg Duty Length, Avg Block Time)
  - Positioned in second row below trip/weighted summaries
- **Files:** `app.py:98-127`
- **Commit:** `3ec026f`

#### 32. **Exclude 1-Day Trips Toggle** ✅
- **What:** Added checkbox to exclude 1-day trips (turns) from distribution charts
- **Features:**
  - Shows count and percentage of 1-day trips in help text
  - Recalculates percentages when filtered
  - Shows caption with current filter status
  - Displays "No trips" message if all trips filtered out
- **Use Case:** Focus on multi-day pairings by removing single-day trips
- **Files:** `app.py:136-175`
- **Commit:** `3ec026f`

#### 33. **Update App Title** ✅
- **What:** Changed title from "EDW Pairing Analyzer" to "Pairing Analyzer Tool 1.0"
- **Reason:** Reflects broader functionality beyond just EDW analysis
- **Changed:**
  - Browser tab title: `st.set_page_config(page_title="Pairing Analyzer Tool 1.0")`
  - Page header: `st.title("Pairing Analyzer Tool 1.0")`
- **Files:** `app.py:7-8`
- **Commit:** `fe2cea6`
