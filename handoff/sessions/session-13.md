# Session 13 - Professional PDF Enhancements & Integration

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Focus:** Bid Line Analyzer PDF Enhancement & EDW Professional PDF Integration

---

## Session Overview

This session focused on upgrading the Bid Line Analyzer PDF export to match the professional styling of the pairing analyzer, and properly integrating the previously-created professional EDW PDF export (`export_pdf.py`) that had been built but never connected to the application.

---

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. **Bid Line Analyzer PDF Complete Rewrite** ✅

Completely rewrote `report_builder.py` (717 lines) to use ReportLab with professional styling matching the pairing analysis PDF.

#### **Changes Made:**
- **Library Migration:** Switched from fpdf2 to ReportLab for consistency
- **Professional Headers:** Blue header bar (#1E40AF) with white title text on every page
- **Professional Footers:** Timestamp (left) and page numbers (right) on every page
- **Enhanced KPI Cards:** Added 4 KPI badges with rounded corners and range information
- **Improved Tables:** Zebra-striped tables with professional color scheme
- **Better Charts:** Professional matplotlib charts with proper styling
- **Page Break Prevention:** Wrapped sections with `KeepTogether` to prevent awkward splits

#### **New Features:**
1. **KPI Cards with Ranges:**
   - Avg Credit: `75.3` with `↑ Range 65.8-85.7`
   - Avg Block: `49.5` with `↑ Range 31.7-66.2`
   - Avg Days Off: `14.0` with `↑ Range 11-16`
   - Avg Duty Days: `12.9` with `↑ Range 11-15`

2. **Header Format:** "ONT 757 - Bid 2507 | Line Analysis Report"

3. **Filter Removal:** Removed cluttered filter display from below title

4. **3-Page Professional Layout:**
   - **Page 1:** KPI cards, Summary stats, Pay period averages, Reserve statistics
   - **Page 2:** CT & BT distributions (tables + charts)
   - **Page 3:** DO distribution, Buy-up analysis (table + pie chart)

### 2. **Header Extraction for Bid Line PDFs** ✅

Added `extract_bid_line_header_info()` function to `bid_parser.py` to extract metadata from bid line PDFs.

#### **Extracted Fields:**
- Bid Period (e.g., "2507")
- Bid Period Date Range (e.g., "02Nov2025 - 30Nov2025")
- Domicile (e.g., "ONT")
- Fleet Type (e.g., "757")
- Date/Time (e.g., "26Sep2025 11:35")

### 3. **Comment Box Added to Bid Line Analyzer** ✅

Added notes text area to Tab 2, matching the EDW analyzer:
- Placeholder: "e.g., Final Data, Round 1, Round 2, etc."
- Always visible for easy access
- Integrated into PDF title and subtitle

### 4. **Intelligent PDF Title Generation** ✅

Enhanced PDF generation to use extracted header information:

**Title Format:**
```
ONT 757 Bid 2507 - Bid Line Analysis
```

**Subtitle Format:**
```
02Nov2025 - 30Nov2025 • Notes: Final Data
```

**Filename Format:**
```
ONT_757_Bid2507_Bid_Line_Analysis.pdf
```

### 5. **Professional EDW PDF Integration** ✅

**The Big Fix:** Properly integrated the previously-created `export_pdf.py` (1,150+ lines) into the application.

#### **Problem:**
- Professional 5-page PDF with 13 charts was created in Session 12
- Never actually connected to the app
- Old basic PDF from `edw_reporter.py` was still being used

#### **Solution:**
- Imported `create_pdf_report` from `export_pdf.py` into `app.py`
- Added data transformation logic to convert EDW results to expected format
- Replaced old PDF download button with professional version
- Added error handling with fallback to basic PDF

#### **Professional EDW PDF Structure (5 Pages):**

**Page 1: Executive Dashboard**
- Main title: "ONT 757 – Bid 2601"
- Subtitle: "Executive Dashboard • Pairing Breakdown & Duty-Day Metrics"
- 4 KPI cards (Unique Pairings, Total Trips, EDW Trips, Day Trips)
- Visual Analytics section:
  - EDW vs Non-EDW pie chart (46.4% / 53.6%)
  - Trip Length Distribution bar chart
- Weighted EDW Metrics table (Trip-weighted, TAFB-weighted, Duty-day-weighted)

**Page 2: Duty Day Statistics**
- Comprehensive statistics table (All, EDW, Non-EDW columns)
- Duty Day Statistics Comparison bar chart
- EDW vs Non-EDW Profile radar chart
- Note about Hot Standby exclusion

**Page 3: Trip Length Breakdown**
- Distribution table by duty days
- Trip Length Distribution (Absolute Numbers) bar chart
- Trip Length Distribution (Percentage) bar chart

**Page 4: Multi-Day Trip Analysis**
- Focused analysis excluding 1-day trips
- Multi-Day Trips (Absolute Numbers) bar chart
- Multi-Day Trips (Percentage) bar chart

**Page 5: EDW Percentages Analysis**
- EDW Percentages by Weighting Method comparison chart
- EDW Distribution by Weighting Method (3 pie charts)
  - Trip-Weighted
  - TAFB-Weighted
  - Duty Day-Weighted

### 6. **EDW Reporter Basic PDF Update** ✅

While integrating the professional PDF, also updated the basic PDF in `edw_reporter.py` with modern styling:
- Added professional header/footer functions
- Enhanced table styling with zebra striping
- Better typography and spacing
- Note: This is now a fallback; professional PDF is primary

        self.height = 70 if range_text else 60  # Taller if showing range
```

### **Data Transformation for Professional PDF:**

"trip_length_distribution": [
    {
        "duty_days": int(row["Duty Days"]),
        "trips": int(row["Trips"])
    }
    for _, row in result_data["res"]["duty_dist"].iterrows()
],
```

## Bug Fixes

1. **Page Break Splits:** Fixed sections splitting across pages
   - Wrapped CT, BT, and DO distributions with `KeepTogether`
   - Tables, charts, and titles now stay together

2. **Data Format Mismatch:** Fixed column name mismatch in EDW PDF
   - Changed from `to_dict('records')` to proper transformation
   - Lowercase keys: `duty_days`, `trips` (not "Duty Days", "Trips")

3. **Filter Clutter:** Removed verbose filter display from PDF title area
   - Was showing: "CT Range: ['65.83', '85.68'] • BT Range..."
   - Now clean with just title and subtitle

## Key Learnings

1. **Integration Oversight:** The professional `export_pdf.py` was created but never integrated - always verify end-to-end functionality

2. **Data Format Consistency:** Column names and data structures must match between modules - proper data transformation is critical

3. **KeepTogether is Essential:** For professional PDF layouts, preventing awkward page breaks significantly improves readability

4. **Consistent Branding:** Using the same color scheme, fonts, and styling across all PDFs creates a cohesive professional appearance
