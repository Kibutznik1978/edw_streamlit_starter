## Session 6 Accomplishments (October 18, 2025)

### Major Features Implemented

#### 28. **Robust Marker-Based Parser** ✅
- **What:** Complete rewrite of trip parsing logic for long-term reliability
- **Problem:** Original parser used fixed line skip counts that varied by flight type
  - UPS/DH flights: Block label at offset 9
  - GT flights: Block label at offset 8
  - Fragile to PDF format changes or new aircraft types
- **Solution:** Marker-based parsing approach
  - Detects flights by pattern matching instead of position
  - Reads fields sequentially, validating each one
  - Skips past actual data read (dynamic offset) not hardcoded counts
  - Uses exact marker matching for duty summaries ("Block", "Duty", "Credit")
- **Implementation Details:**
  - **Flight Detection:**
    - Case 1: Day pattern `^\d+\s+\(` followed by flight number `^(UPS|GT|DH)`
    - Case 2: Flight number without day pattern (continuation flight)
  - **Sequential Field Reading:**
    - Route: `^[A-Z]{3}-[A-Z]{3}$` pattern
    - Depart time: `\(\d+\)\d{2}:\d{2}` pattern
    - Arrive time: same as depart
    - Block time: `\d+h\d+` pattern
    - Aircraft type: `^[0-9]{2}[A-Z]$` (skip, not stored)
    - Connection time: Look ahead for next `\d+h\d+` pattern
    - Crew needs: `^\d+/\d+/\d+$` (skip, not stored)
  - **Dynamic Skip:**
    - After reading all fields, `i += offset` (where offset = fields actually read)
    - No hardcoded skip counts
    - Works regardless of format variations
- **Benefits:**
  - **Resilient:** Handles variations in field presence/order
  - **Self-documenting:** Clear what each step does
  - **Debuggable:** Easy to trace what went wrong if it fails
  - **Future-proof:** Will adapt to new PDF templates gracefully
- **Testing:**
  - Compared against original parser across 5 representative trips
  - 100% match in all fields (flights, duty days, Block subtotals)
  - Tested across all 272 trips: 100% success rate
  - All 1,127 duty days have Block subtotals captured
  - Zero parsing errors
- **Files:** `edw_reporter.py:255-508`

### Files Modified (Session 6)
- `edw_reporter.py`:
  - Completely rewrote `parse_trip_for_table()` function (lines 255-508)
  - Added detailed docstring explaining marker-based approach
  - Added inline comments for each parsing stage
- `HANDOFF.md`:
  - Documented robust parser implementation
  - Added Session 6 section

### Test Scripts Created (Session 6)
- `test_structure_variability.py` - Discovered Block offset varies by flight type
- `test_comprehensive_structure.py` - Analyzed all 1,092 duty days for offset patterns
- `understand_gt_structure.py` - Examined GT vs UPS structural differences
- `test_new_parser.py` - Comprehensive comparison of old vs new parser
- `test_all_trips_new_parser.py` - Validation across all 272 trips

### Test Results (Session 6)

**Structure Variability Analysis - Key Finding:**
- UPS flights: Block at offset 9 (835 duty days, 100%)
- DH flights: Block at offset 9 (218 duty days, 100%)
- GT flights: Block at offset 8 (39 duty days, 100%)
- **Conclusion:** Fixed skip counts are fragile!

**New Parser Comparison Test - PASS ✅**
- Trip 100 (UPS): 2 flights, Block=4h50 ✓
- Trip 170 (GT): 3 flights, Block=0h45 ✓
- Trip 198 (GT multi-day): 3 duty days, all Block subtotals ✓
- Trip 203 (DH flights): 4 duty days, all Block subtotals ✓
- Trip 197 (multi-day): 2 duty days, all Block subtotals ✓
- **Result:** 100% match with original parser

**Comprehensive Test - PASS ✅**
- 272 trips processed
- 1,127 duty days parsed
- 1,127 Block subtotals captured (100%)
- 0 parsing errors
- **Success rate: 100.0%**

#### 29. **Single-Line PDF Format Support** ✅
- **Problem:** New PDF (BID2507) has fundamentally different format from old PDF (BID2601)
  - **Old format (multi-line):** Each field on separate line
    ```
    1 (Su)Su
    UPS5969
    ONT-SDF
    (06)14:30
    (13)18:10
    3h40
    ```
  - **New format (single-line):** All flight data on one line
    ```
    1 (Su)Su UPS5969 ONT-SDF (06)14:30 (13)18:10 3h40 76P 1h48 1/1/0 Block 6h19 Domicile: ONT
    ```
- **Solution:** Enhanced parser to detect and handle both formats
  - **Format Detection:**
    - Check if line has day pattern AND contains flight number
    - If yes: Single-line format (all data on one line)
    - If no: Multi-line format (fields on sequential lines)
  - **Single-Line Parsing:**
    - Extract all fields using regex from one line
    - Day pattern: `r'^(\d+\s+\([^)]*\)\S*)'`
    - Flight number: `r'((?:UPS|GT|DH)\s*\S+)'`
    - Route: `r'([A-Z]{3}-[A-Z]{3})'`
    - Times: `r'\((\d+)\)(\d{2}:\d{2})'` (multiple matches)
    - Block subtotal: `r'\bBlock\s+(\d+h\d+)'`
    - Credit: `r'\bCredit\s+(\S+)'` (added in fix)
  - **Briefing/Debriefing Parsing:**
    - Multi-line: "Briefing" on one line, time on next
    - Single-line: `Briefing (05)13:30 1h00 Duty 9h22 ...`
    - Extract embedded Duty time and Credit from same line
- **Testing:**
  - Old PDF (BID2601): 272 trips, 1,127 duty days, 100% success
  - New PDF (BID2507): 128 trips, 530 duty days, initial 0% → fixed to 100%
- **Files:** `edw_reporter.py:300-460`

#### 30. **Credit Extraction Fix for Single-Line Format** ✅
- **Problem:** Credit field missing in 50 out of 530 duty days (90.6% success)
  - Credit appeared in flight lines, not Briefing/Debriefing lines
  - Example: `2 (We)Th UPS2980-2 PDX-BFI ... Credit 6h32L Block Time: 6h32`
  - Single-line parser consumed these lines and continued before Credit extraction logic ran
- **Root Cause:**
  - Single-line flight parsing at lines 408-452 parses flight and does `i += 1; continue`
  - Credit extraction logic at lines 545-558 runs in general duty day section AFTER flight parsing
  - When Credit appears in flight line, parser skips past it before Credit logic can run
- **Solution:** Extract Credit within single-line flight parsing, similar to Block subtotal
  - Added Credit extraction at lines 450-456 (within single-line parsing section)
  - Pattern: `r'\bCredit\s+(\S+)'` (but NOT "Credit Time:")
  - Runs before `continue` statement, so captures Credit before moving on
- **Testing:**
  - Before fix: 480/530 duty days (90.6%)
  - After fix: 530/530 duty days (100.0%)
  - Trip 29, Duty Day 1: Now correctly captures Credit "6h32L" from flight line
- **Files:** `edw_reporter.py:450-456`

### Test Scripts Created (Session 6 Continuation)
- `debug_block_capture.py` - Compare Block label format in both PDFs
- `analyze_new_pdf.py` - Analyze new PDF structure
- `test_format_detection.py` - Detect single-line vs multi-line format
- `test_credit_fix.py` - Validate Credit extraction after fix
- `test_both_pdfs_final.py` - Final validation for both PDF formats

### Test Results (Session 6 Final)

**Old PDF (BID2601) - Multi-Line Format - PASS ✅**
- Total trips: 272
- Total duty days: 1,127
- Block Total: 1,127/1,127 (100.0%)
- Duty Time: 1,127/1,127 (100.0%)
- Credit: 1,127/1,127 (100.0%)

**New PDF (BID2507) - Single-Line Format - PASS ✅**
- Total trips: 128
- Total duty days: 530
- Block Total: 530/530 (100.0%)
- Duty Time: 530/530 (100.0%)
- Credit: 530/530 (100.0%)

**Trip 29 (Credit in Flight Lines) - PASS ✅**
- Duty Day 1:
  - Block Total: 6h32 ✅
  - Duty Time: 11h08 ✅
  - Credit: 6h32L ✅ (was None before fix)

**Overall: BOTH PDF FORMATS FULLY SUPPORTED ✅**

### Commit 7 (Session 6): "Add support for single-line and multi-line PDF formats"
- **Identified fragility in fixed-skip parser:** Block offset varies by flight type (GT=8, UPS/DH=9)
- **Rewrote `parse_trip_for_table()` with marker-based approach:**

  - Single-line: All flight data on one line with embedded Block/Credit
  - Multi-line: Each field on separate sequential lines
  - Handles both formats seamlessly in same parser
- **Fixed Credit extraction for single-line format:**
  - Credit now extracted within flight parsing (before continue)
  - Handles Credit appearing in flight lines (e.g., "... Credit 6h32L ...")
  - Brought Credit success rate from 90.6% to 100%
- **Testing results:**
  - Old PDF (BID2601 multi-line): 272 trips, 1,127 duty days - 100% success
  - New PDF (BID2507 single-line): 128 trips, 530 duty days - 100% success
  - All fields: Block, Duty, Credit at 100% for both formats
- **Benefits:**
  - Parser now handles both PDF templates from different bid periods
  - Future-proof for PDF format variations
  - Resilient to field order changes and embedded data
- **Files:** `edw_reporter.py:255-614`
