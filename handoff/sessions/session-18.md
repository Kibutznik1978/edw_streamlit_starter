# Session 18: PDF Export Enhancements & SAFTE Model Fixes

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Focus:** Hot standby metrics in PDFs, critical SAFTE time parsing fixes, AutoSleep improvements, and interactive chart enhancements

---

## Overview

This session focused on fixing critical bugs in the SAFTE fatigue model and enhancing the PDF export system with hot standby metrics. Major fixes included correcting time parsing (critical bug), improving sleep prediction algorithms, and adding interactive tooltips to the SAFTE chart.

---

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. Time Parsing Bug in SAFTE Integration ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Problem:**
- The `parse_local_time()` function completely misunderstood the time format
- Was treating `(LOCAL_HH)MM:SS` when format is actually `(LOCAL_HH)ZULU_HH:ZULU_MM`
- Example: "(03)08:28" was parsed as 03:08:28 instead of 03:28:00

**Impact:**
- Duty periods had completely wrong times
- Sleep periods overlapped with duties
- Reservoir depleted to 0% because pilot appeared awake for 100+ hours straight
- Only first sleep period was counted (~5 hours instead of 39 hours)

**Fix:**
```python
# OLD (WRONG):
local_hour = int(match.group(1))  # (03)
minute = int(match.group(2))      # 08 ❌ This is ZULU hour!
second = int(match.group(3))      # 28

# NEW (CORRECT):
local_hour = int(match.group(1))  # (03) ✓ Local hour
zulu_hour = int(match.group(2))   # 08 (not used for local time)
minute = int(match.group(3))      # 28 ✓ Minutes
second = 0                         # Not provided
```

**Files Modified:**
- `safte_integration.py:13-45` - Complete rewrite of `parse_local_time()`

---

### 2. AutoSleep Algorithm - Rigid Night-time Restriction

**Problem:**
- Algorithm forced sleep to wait until 23:00 for any duty ending between 12:00-23:59
- Unrealistic for pilots on multi-day trips with red-eyes
- Missing sleep opportunities on Oct 26 (and other days)
- Example: Duty ends 10:28 AM after red-eye → forced to wait until 11 PM to sleep

**Old Algorithm:**
- **Rule 1**: Duty ends 00:00-11:59 → sleep immediately ✓
- **Rule 2**: Duty ends 12:00-23:59 → **FORCE WAIT until 23:00** ❌

**New Algorithm:**
After each duty period:
1. Wind-down buffer: duty end + commute (30 min) + decompress (1 hour)
2. Sleep immediately after wind-down (no artificial restrictions)
3. Sleep up to 8 hours or until next duty wake time
4. Minimum 2 hours to count as valid sleep

**Why This Works:**
- Circadian rhythm in SAFTE model naturally handles sleep quality
- Daytime sleep: Lower accumulation rate (~45% reduced)
- Night-time sleep: Higher accumulation rate (~45% enhanced)

**Files Modified:**
- `safte_model.py:228-251` - Simplified AutoSleep algorithm

---

### 3. Date Advancement Bug - Missing Duty Periods

**Problem:**
- Old logic blindly advanced `current_date` by 1 day after each duty
- Caused multiple duties on same day to be skipped
- Example: Duty 2 ends 04:28, Duty 3 starts 21:00 same day → Duty 3 placed on next day
- Created 41-hour gaps with no duty and no sleep

**Old Logic:**
```python
# Always advance to next day after each duty
current_date += timedelta(days=1)  # ❌ Skips same-day duties
```

**New Logic:**
```python
# Track last duty end time
if last_duty_end is not None:
    # If next duty would overlap (within 2 hours), advance to next day
    if duty_start <= last_duty_end + timedelta(hours=2):
        current_date += timedelta(days=1)
    # Otherwise, keep on current day ✓
```

**Files Modified:**
- `safte_integration.py:73-136` - Rewrote date advancement logic in `trip_to_duty_periods()`

---

## PDF Export Enhancements

### 1. Hot Standby KPI Card

**Added:**
- New 5th KPI card: "Hot Standby Trips"
- Shows frequency-weighted count of hot standby trips

**Modified Total Trips KPI:**
- Main value: Total trips (e.g., "228")
- Subtitle: "Non-HSBY: 174" (trips excluding hot standby)

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced `KPIBadge` class to support optional subtitle parameter
- Updated `_make_kpi_row()` to handle 5 KPIs and dict values
- Adjusted column widths: 105px for 5 badges vs 130px for 4

**Files Modified:**
- `export_pdf.py:103-175` - Enhanced KPIBadge and _make_kpi_row
- `app.py:1172-1192` - Updated PDF data preparation

---

### 2. Trip Length Table Percentage Fix

**Problem:**
- Table percentages: 38.6% (included hot standby in total)
- Chart percentages: 50.6% (excluded hot standby from total)
- Mismatch due to different total calculations

**Fix:**
```python
# Calculate total from trip_length_distribution (excludes hot standby)
total_trips_excluding_hot_standby = sum(item["trips"] for item in trip_length_distribution)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `export_pdf.py:225-241` - Updated `_make_trip_length_table()`
- `export_pdf.py:772-782` - Added handling for dict-type Total Trips value

---

### 3. PDF Header Extraction - Cover Page Support

**Problem:**
- Only checked page 0 for header information
- Final/official PDFs have cover pages, so data is on page 1 or 2

**Fix:**
- Now searches first 3 pages for header information
- Stops early once all required fields found
- Handles both PDFs with and without cover pages

**Files Modified:**
- `edw_reporter.py:120-187` - Rewrote `extract_pdf_header_info()`

---

## SAFTE Chart Enhancements

### 1. Interactive Tooltips

**Added hover tooltips for:**

**Duty Bars (Dark Gray):**
- Duty Period number
- Start/End times with day-of-week
- Duration in hours
- **Actual flight routes** (e.g., "ONT-PHL, PHL-CAE")

**Layover Bars (Light Gray):**
- Rest Period number
- Start/End times
- Duration

**Sleep Bars (Blue):**
- Sleep Period number
- Start/End times
- Duration

**Implementation:**
- Added tooltip data to each bar type
- Extracted flight routes from duty_days structure
- Formatted routes as comma-separated list

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py:979-1091` - Added tooltip data and encoding

---

### 2. Chart Spacing Improvements

**Attempted:**
- Increased chart height: 400px → 500px
- Added bottom padding: 80px
- Moved flight labels lower: y=-34 → y=-40
- Updated legend: "— *Hover for details*"

**Note:** Pan/zoom functionality was attempted but rolled back due to poor UX

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py:1049-1061, 1082-1083, 1141, 1147-1154` - Chart configuration and legend

---

3. **Sleep prediction validation** - Verify sleep periods match realistic pilot rest patterns

**Medium Priority:**
4. **Circadian validation** - Deep validation of circadian rhythm calculations
5. **Performance rhythm validation** - Verify amplitude modulation across scenarios
6. **Transmeridian adjustments** - Time zone crossings for international trips

**Low Priority:**
7. **Export SAFTE results to PDF** - Add SAFTE chart and metrics to PDF reports
8. **Supabase integration** - Historical trend analysis (Tab 3)

## Key Learnings

1. **Time Format Complexity:**
   - Airline scheduling systems use complex time formats combining local and zulu times
   - Critical to validate time parsing with actual data examples
   - Small parsing errors cascade into massive simulation errors

2. **AutoSleep Simplification:**
   - Complex rule-based sleep prediction can be replaced with simpler approach
   - Circadian modulation in SAFTE naturally handles sleep quality differences
   - Let the model do the work instead of hardcoding restrictions

3. **Date Arithmetic:**
   - Multi-day trip scheduling is complex (overnight duties, multiple same-day duties)
   - Timeline-aware logic is better than calendar-day assumptions
   - Use actual duty end times to determine next duty date

4. **Interactive Tooltips > Static Labels:**
   - Tooltips provide much better UX than cramped overlapping text
   - Can show rich information without cluttering the chart
   - More scalable for complex schedules

## Conclusion

This session resolved **three critical bugs** in the SAFTE fatigue model that were causing completely unrealistic results (0% effectiveness, missing sleep periods, missing duty periods). The fixes now allow the model to:

- ✅ Correctly parse local times from PDF data
- ✅ Predict realistic sleep opportunities after every duty period
- ✅ Handle complex multi-day trip schedules with same-day duties
- ✅ Show proper reservoir recovery during sleep periods
- ✅ Display accurate fatigue metrics for real pilot schedules

**Status:** ✅ SAFTE model now producing realistic fatigue analysis for complex multi-day trips

**Next Focus:** Test with real pilot schedules, commit critical bug fixes, consider SAFTE PDF export integration
